# Hi

I've wanted a good place to put up my thoughts onto the web without having to faff about with godaddy and other website builders. Ultimately, the goal is to build up to building a real website/youtube channel about my interests. Let get into that, shall we?

## What am I Interested In?

### Cycling

This one has been capturing most of my interest in the past little bit. I've been trying to maintain my cycling habit as school gets busier, but it got quite difficult over reading week and the subsequent 4 midterms I've had to write this past week. But that doesn't stop me from setting records on Strava.

<div class="strava-embed-placeholder" data-embed-type="activity" data-embed-id="16266896244" data-style="standard" data-from-embed="false"></div><script src="https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js"></script>

I have to finish this post now, but I'll get back to it later.
